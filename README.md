# Dangernoodles

A rewrite of the infamous [Dangernoodles game](https://github.com/aratare-tech/old-dangernoodles) made by a class which I attended during university. It was fun to write and play the game so I decided to spend some time and efforts to make it great again.

This project aims to:
- Fix everything buggy about the project, and
- Modernise everything to Kotlin, and
- General cleaning and ordering.

This proejct is just to keep the spirit and "good old time" alive with no intention to make new features whatsoever. I may change my mind in the future who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute with any feature you want. Obviously the bar is low but I intend to at least keep the code base clean.
